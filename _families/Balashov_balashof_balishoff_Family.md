# Balashov/Balashof/Balishoff

**Balashov** is a town in Saratov Oblast, Russia, located on the Khopyor
River. It was known as the *village* of **Balashovo** since the end of
the 18th century. In 1780, it was granted town status and became known
as Balashov. It is likely that the original Russian Balashov who came to
Alaska was from this location. It is not known where the Creole families
originated in Alaska but by 1900 there were 2 Balashoff families living
in Seldovia and they continued to show up in Seldovia census records
through 1940, the most recently made public.

There are 8 individuals interred in the Seldovia City Cemetery with the Balashof surname. Three of
them are infants. Adam Blochâ€™s 2<sup>nd</sup> wife [Elizabeth Balashoff
Bloch Markle](../_people/Markle_Elizabeth_Bloch.md) is buried in the Seldovia
Hill Cemetery in the town. See more information about her in the Bloch
Family section.
