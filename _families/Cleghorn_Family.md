# CLEGHORN FAMILY

JAMES NAISMITH CLEGHORN, was born on November 22, 1852 in Lewiston, New York to Nasmith and Elizabeth Cleghorn.  His father was born in Scotland and his mother in Ireland.
James came to Alaska in 1886.  He and his partner, Harry Mellish crossed the Yukon River near the Russian Mission Portae and went up the Kuskokwim River in search of gold in 1890, long before the gold rush of 1897.  Finding very little gold, the men spent the winter of 1890-91 in the village of Kolmakov near the confluence of the Kuskokwim River and the Holitna River.

The next season, Mellish and Cleghorn searched the Mulchatna River area but found only small quantities of super-fine gold. In 1892, the men split up and Cleghorn went on to marry an Athabascan woman named Mary Shitachka (Paul? Panfeelof?) of Tyonek in about 1893. (The 1900 census in Susitna Station lists Mary as a member of the Tyonek Tribe but the 1910 U.S. Census for Ouzinkie, Spruce Island, lists her as Athabascan--Kutchin Tribe, from Kantishna and date of birth May 1874.)
By 1896, James Cleghorn was the Alaska Commercial Company agent at Susitna Station. In 1902 the original Postmaster ceded his position as well as his trading company position to James Cleghorn.  In 1910, the family was living in Ouzinkie on Spruce Island near Kodiak and times were tough. An article written in the San Francisco Call (newspaper) in 1912, said they had received word that the Cleghorns and their 12 children were trying to live on $25 a month. U.S. Treasury Secretary Wayne McVeagh was so concerned that he offered the Cleghorns free passage out of the area on a U.S. Revenue Cutter. 
By 1920, the family was operating a fox farm on Yukon Island. James Cleghorn and his wife are both buried in Seldovia’s Hillside Cemetery below the Russian Orthodox Church.  (James 1852-1928) (Mary 1866-1932).
