# RITCHIE FAMILY


[**ULYSSES S. “U.S.” RITCHIE**](../_people/Ritchie_Ulyses_Grant.md) was the first of the Ritchie family to come to Seldovia.  He was born into a Quaker family in Chester, Pennsylvania in October of 1868.  He is first listed in Alaska in 1910 census records where he is living on Yukon Island, with his wife Annie and sons, GEORGE, Sam, and Jim.  Annie was born in Alaska. In 1920, only son George is listed with them. 

In 1921 U.S. had applied for a post as US Postmaster in Seldovia, but failed to qualify.  George married Mary Simeneoff in 1923 and U.S. married Mary Toco in 1925.   In 1930 U.S. is listed in Seldovia as a widower living with son George, also a widower; he is a carpenter and George is a fisherman.   In 1940 both U.S. and George are living together in Seldovia, and both are listed as widowers but I haven’t found a record of a marriage for George.

Near where the theater used to be, George built a two story house with lots of shingles and a round tower, where he could sun bathe on it. The next year the BIA school was built right across the street and he didn’t get to do much sun bathing. (From Fred Elvsaas interview)
