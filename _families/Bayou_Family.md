19<sup>th</sup> century and married an Alaska Native women, as they
descendants are sometimes listed as

**Wassilii Bayou** was born in 1873 in Alaska. Most census records claim
that both of his parents were born in Alaska. He and his wife, Christina
were living in Seldovia with 3 children and he was listed as a laborer.
In 1910, the family was in Ninilchik with 4 children and he was listed
as a shop keeper. In 1920 they were back in Kachemak Bay where he was a
logger at a pile camp. Christina died not long after that and Wassilii
married 2<sup>nd</sup> Eva Odoyiah Hunter September 22, 1925. Wassilii
was a trapper in Seldovia at the time of the 1930 census. He died May
10, 1937 and is buried in Seldovia City Cemetery, Plot \# 91.

**Eva ODOYIAH BACKOFF Hunter Bayou** b. 1882, d. 1937, married 1st
