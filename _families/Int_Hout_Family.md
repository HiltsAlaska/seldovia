The INT-HOUT in Seldovia began with two brothers, [**“TUGGLE”**](../_people/Int_Hout_Garland_Brooks_Tuggle.md) and [**“PIERRE”**](../_people/Int_Hout_John_Pierre.md), who arrived in 1946. Tuggle said ““I had an uncle that was up here in 1917, during World War I, and he used to tell us some wild stories,” said Pierre Int-Hout. “My brother and I came up to see if it was true.” Tuggle and Pierre were born in Garland, Illinois to John and Garland Int-hout. Although John was born in Illinois his father and mother were born in the Netherlands and immigrated early in their marriage. Both Tuggle and Pierre served in WWII.  Their trip to Alaska ended up in becoming lifetime adventures.
