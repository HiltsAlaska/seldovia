# CRAWFORD Family

**Reinhardt Leroy Crawford** was born in Washington in 1915. He came to
Anchorage in 1919 with his parents on the *S.S. Northwestern*, which
anchored in the Inlet near Anchorage. Because there were no docking
facilities, the passengers were ferried to shore aboard smaller boats.
He grew up in Anchorage and attended local schools. Later he became a
fur trapper near McGrath. He married [**Hettie Hultberg Conrad**](../_people/Crawford_Hettie_M_Conrad.md) and they had
three children. The family moved from McGrath to Anchorage, Fairbanks,
and eventually Seldovia in about 1948. Leroy worked on fishing tenders
boats and later had his own mechanical shop. He died in Seward in 1973
and is buried there near his parents.
