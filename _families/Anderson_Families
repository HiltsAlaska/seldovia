# Anderson Families

It is often very confusing to figure out the relationships or lack of relationship of the many Andersons who have lived in Seldovia. It is likely that all of these family lines originated in a Scandinavian country at some point, but while many came directly from Norway or Sweden, some were born in this country and perhaps even in Alaska.  Here is a brief look at some of the many Anderson lines of Seldovia, and links to their personal stories.
