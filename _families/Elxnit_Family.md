# ELXNIT Family

The many Elxnit family members in Seldovia originate from Alexander Vacabuf Elxnit, born in Togan Rog, Russia in August 3, 1866.  He married [**Alexandria Potorochin**](../_people/Elxnit_Alexandria_Potorochin.md) in Kodiak, Alaska on August 3, 1912.  She had previously been married to Harry"Rufus Grenieff. Harry Grenieff was born on August 27, 1870, in Russia (now Finland). He married [**Aleksandra Fomin Potorochin**](../_people/Elxnit_Alexandria_Potorochin.md) on November 24, 1902. They had two children during their marriage - [**Nick Grenieff Elxnit**](../_people/Elxnit_Nick_Grenieff.md) and [**Dora Grenieff Elxnit**](../_people/Ursin_Axel.md). He died on January 6, 1912, in Kasilof, Alaska, at the age of 41.

Alexander had many brush-ins with the law in Alaska, related to larceny and assault with a dangerous weapon, and in October 1932 he was sentenced to 8 years in prison at McNeil Island in Washington State. He served his time and was living in Washington State at the time of his death in 1946. It is not clear whether he and Alexandria were officially divorced, but she was listed as a widow in 1930 and married in 1940.  She died in 1966.
