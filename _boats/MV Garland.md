# The MV Garland

MV Garland was built in Port Townsend in 1890 and was 97’ long and 18-1/2’ wide. It was originally part of a flotilla of steam ships owned by the Puget Sound Navigation Company known as the “Mosquito Fleet” that sailed the waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca route between 1890 and 1903. The ship was built for towing and hauling freight and in 1900 was lengthened to 120 feet to accommodate passengers. In 1903 the company was consolidated with several others into the Alaska Steamship Company.   It was transferred out of that service in 1909 but was still operational for another half century.

Sometime after WWII, the MV Garland was bought by Heinie Berger, owner of  Berger Transportation Company .  Berger Transportation Company operated MV Garland to and from Puget Sound ports and Alaska outports carrying mail, passengers and freight.  When Heinie Berger died in 1954 his estate was sold off.

Many of Alaska’s best seamen got their start aboard the MV Garland. Captain Richard Hofstad, who pioneered routes for the Alaska Marine Highway in its earlier years, learned those routes from his Chief Mate Jack V. Johnson who had sailed mail boat routes on the Garland.
