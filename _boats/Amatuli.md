# The FV Amatuli

The FV Amatuli is a 111’ fishing vessel, built in 1967 by Pacific Fisherman Shipyard in Ballard, Washington for [**Joe Kurtz**](../_people/Kurtz_Joseph_R.md) of Seldova, Alaska. It was sold to Bart Eaton in 1974, and became a part of Trident Seafoods later in the decade. As one of the top high liners in the Bering Sea, the Amatuli was “the boat to fish on”. In 1988 she was sold to Bill Widing, Dan Gunn, & Peter Liske… In 1999 Peter sold out to Bill and Dan. In 2009 Dan Mattsen bought Dan Gunn out. She is currently owned by Mattsen and Widing. Her captains are Bryce Buholm and Robert Pattison.

She starts her year filming Opilio crab for Deadliest Catch as the chase boat. Then in the beginning of March she goes to Chignik to tender cod, time permitting they will hit Sitka for herring. In the beginning of May she makes her way to Togiak (western Bristol Bay) for another herring fishery. June, July and Augest she tender salmon in The Shumigan Islands, Bristol Bay, Prince William Sound, and sometimes Dutch Harbor or Kodiak In the fall they fish or tender cod. Starting October 15 we start filming King Crab for deadliest catch that usually finishes our year, give or take the random charter we pick up.
