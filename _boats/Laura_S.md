# F/V Laura S

The F/V ***Laura S***, owned by Ken Swick, was built in Seattle in 1977. She is a 58-foot fiberglass boat made originally for crab fishing in Cook Inlet. The Swicks fished for king crab and tanner crab until 1984, and then seasons were shortened and eventually closed.  In 1985 they started halibut fishing in area 3A (in the Gulf), and 3B (south of Kodiak).  In 1987 they began black cod fishing in combination with halibut.  The first 10 years of long lining were under the old Derby System, seasons were short and all the fish were landed in a very short time.  Quality wasnâ€™t always the best with so many fish hitting the docks at the same time.
In 1995 the IFQ (Individual Fishing Quota) system was put into effect for halibut and black cod. Under this plan each boat was given a certain number of pounds based on prior years of fishing. His limited the number of boats and lengthened the season.  Quality therefore increased with more of the fish going straight to fresh markets.   _ Alvin Swick, Captain
