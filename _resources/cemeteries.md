**Seldovia Hillside Cemetery**

The first cemetery in Seldovia was located near the Russian Orthodox Church. Some sites were located on the hillside just below the church above Main Street near the ferry dock.  Adam Bloch was the first person buried in this spot and there are several fenced-in family sections still there.
The majority of graves were down on the flats at the base of the cliff, closer to the beach.  This section was always predominantly marked with crosses and no names, the majority being Native Alaskans who died in three epidemics of measles (1900), influenza (1918) and pneumonia (mid-1920s). 

**Seldovia City Cemetery**

In 1935, citizen Frank Raby donated a piece of land to the City of Seldovia to be used for a new cemetery. The site is actually outside of city limits, on the road to Outside Beach.  The first burial in the new cemetery, in 1936, was that of Terry Meehan, a 10 year old boy who accidentally shot himself when out hunting.

After the 1964 earthquake, as part of the Urban Renewal Program, the city contracted with Walter Muller, the mortician from Kodiak, to move 285 persons to this location from the old cemetery next to the boardwalk. These persons are buried in rows marked by white Russian Orthodox crosses at the back of the cemetery. The majority of the graves that were moved are unidentified, but there are about ten of them that have grave markers.

In 1971, Frank Raby donated additional land to the cemetery site.  Today there are over 700 graves located in the City Cemetery that mirror the town’s ethnic diversity..  They represent those Alaska Native, Russian, Scandinavian, “Lower 48” and even Japanese forebears who built Seldovia.
