History of the Flight :
Float equipped Fairchild Hiller, FH-1100 helicopter, Nl8845, is owned and operated by Totem Helicopters, Inc., Box 357, Homer, Alaska, 99603. On December 19, 1977, it was being piloted by Gary Allen Terry on a non-scheduled air taxi flight. The planned route of flight was to be from Homer, to Anchor Point, to the steam ship (S.S) Great Land located in Cook Inlet, and then return to Homer, Alaska. * The helicopter departed Homer at 1808 AST with the pilot and one passenger on board. The passenger, a marine pilot, was to disembark on the S.S. Great Land , which was enroute to Anchorage, Alaska. Two witnesses observed a helicopter over Anchor Point at approximately 1820 hour flying in heavy snow with poor visibility. Mrs. Marjorie Klein, who is a secretary for the Kenai Peninsula Borough, saw a helicopter with its landing light on as it passed low over her car at Mile 157 of the Sterling Highway. She stated that she thought the helicopter was trying to find a place to land because the weather was so bad. She continued to observe the helicopter and saw that the landing light went out; the helicopter made a sharp turn towards the bay (to the north-west) and disappeared in the snow and fog. A witness statement from Mrs. Klein is enclosed and included as part of this report. At approximately the same time, around 1820 hours, Officer Bruce Bayes, who is a Judicial Services Officer employed by the Alaska State Troopers, observed a helicopter flying low over Anchor Point. Officer Bayes was also driving on the Sterling Highway He stated that the visibility was so poor due to blowing snow that he had to reduce his automobile’s speed and keep his headlights on low beam. With high beams on it was reported there was too much light reflecting off the heavy snowfall creating a blinding effect. Neither witness could positively identify the helicopter as N-18845.  Captain Harold L. Small, who is the Ship Master of the S.S. Great Land, stated that due to encountering poor weather conditions while approaching Anchor Point, he decided to change his ships course from a northerly heading to 120 degrees true in order to run up under land for embarking the marine pilot from the helicopter. The ships original course would have taken it to a point where the helicopter normally rendezvous with the S.S. Great Land, which is 4 to 5 miles due west of Anchor Point. Captain Small advised the helicopter by radio that due to poor weather in the vicinity of Anchor Point he was turning into Kachemak Bay to make the pick up in the "bluff area" about 2/3rds of the way from Anchor Point to Homer. The helicopter pilot then advised Captain Small that he was hovering in the area of Anchor Point. Captain Small suggested to the helicopter pilot that he fly down to and then out from the bluff area to meet up with the ship because the weather was better there. About ten minutes later, Captain Small observed the helicopter on the ships radar heading generally toward the ship in a southerly direction. This would place the helicopter out over Cook Inlet. Captain Small advised the helicopter pilot that he had him on radar. The pilot
An autopsy and toxicological study was performed on the passenger by Donald R. Rogers, M.D., Pathologist, at the Walsh Mortuary in Kenai, Alaska. There was nothing noted in the autopsy or toxicological screen that could be considered contributory to the accident. The cause of death was diagnosed as-drowning due to possible hypothermia. When the life raft was found, there was water inside of it ..
Based upon the fact that the passenger had no impact injuries; he was able to exit the helicopter; inflate the life raft, and get into it; this accident must be classified as survivable.
