# Leroy "Cricket" FORREST

## 1936, Alaska -- July 3, 1948, Seldovia, Alaska

**Leroy "Cricket" Forrest** was only 11 years old when he
drowned in Seldovia on July 3, 1948. His mother was Helen Skinner of
Unga Island, but he was living with his grandparents **Walter and Nellie
Arkhimandritov Hansen Forrest** in Seldovia at the time of
his death. Nellie was Cricket's grandmother and she and Walter had been
raising him from an early age. In 1940 the family was living in Naknek,
Alaska and Leroy was listed as Walter's "step grandson in-law". Helen
was Nellie's daughter by her husband Charles Skinner. By 1930 Charles
and Helen were divorced and Helen and two of her younger sisters were
living at the Jesse Lee Home, an orphanage in Seward, Alaska.

Old-timers sometimes confuse this cemetery name with "**Jimminy
Cricket**" another Seldovia character, but Jimminy Cricket was an older
black man and locals have many colorful stories about him.
