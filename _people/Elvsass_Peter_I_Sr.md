Peter was a lifelong Alaskan and spent most of that life in Seldovia. He attended high school in Ballard, Wash. He also lived and fished out of Kodiak for 10 years. He worked as a commercial fisherman from the age of 16 and retired due to illness.  He was a lifetime fisherman, which he loved whether commercial or for subsistence. His life was being out at sea, on his boats in rough or calm waters. He also was a very hard worker at whatever was his goal to accomplish. He enjoyed building boats, skiffs and fishing.
