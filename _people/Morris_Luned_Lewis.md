**LUNED *LEWIS* MORRIS** was born in Wales April 13, 1885. She corresponded with [**Richard C. Morris**](./Morris_Richard_C.md) for 10 years when he was in Alaska and in 1918 he returned to Wales to marry her. They returned to Nenana, Alaska in the spring of 1919. In 1922 their son,
Berwyn was born, but their happiness was short-lived when they lost him
in the 1923 flu epidemic.

Richard was President of the Nenana Pioneers when President Harding came
to Nenana and was made an honorary member. Richard handed the President
the golden spike when the railroad officially opened that section. In
1924 he was Vice President of the Grand Igloo in Fairbanks and later
became President.

Grieving for their little son, the couple decided to make a change. They
found a small store for sale in Seldovia and moved there in 1925. The
small town had two churches, a school, one other store, a doctor and
three very busy salteries. They moved into a small house built on
pilings over the water. Their daughter [**Luned MORRIS Inglima**](./Inglima_Luned_Morris.md) was born
in 1926 and the son **Richard Ardudury Morris**, "Dickie", in 1928.
Things were going well and they built a new home overlooking the bay.

In 1930 disaster struck when the herring disappeared. The canneries and
salteries went broke, checks bounced. It was hared on the business
people who carried accounts but everyone shared. The WPA and CCC helped.
In 1954 they retired from the business and briefly moved Outside, but
Richard soon contracted cancer and they returned to Alaska. He died
in1955 and Luned in 1969. They are buried next to each other in the
Seldovia City Cemetery \#82 and \#83.
