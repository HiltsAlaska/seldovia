**ANDREAS ANDERSON, "ANDY** was born June 27, 1893 in Bergen, Norway.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1910, and served as a Private in the U.S. Infantry during World War I. 

He married Inga Johansen in Seldovia on October 3, 1919. They had two children, **Agnes** (1920-2000) and **Anthony "Tony"** (1929-1952).

Andy was listed as an engineer on a gas tug in Seldovia in the 1920 US Census. In 1930 he was a salmon fisherman, in 1940 a foreman on a road consruction project and in 1941 he was a U.S. Federal Marshall, all while living in Seldovia with Inga and his family. Russell Waterbury was a cook at the Seldovia jail when Andy was the local Marshall. Locals remember that at the time locals would sometimes get drunk and do something to get arrested so that they could get some room and board at the jail.

In the 1930's, Andy built a house for Inga.  She was a short woman, and the cupboards are low, the stove is low, he trimmed the legs on the stove and built everything for her size.  Agnes and Tony were both big like Andy - Andy was a six footer - and they'd look so funny in that
house, because the cupboards were low and they were so tall, but he built the house for her. (From Fred Elvsaas' memories).

Andy and Inga are both buried in the Mount Angeles Memorial Park in Port Angeles, Washington.
