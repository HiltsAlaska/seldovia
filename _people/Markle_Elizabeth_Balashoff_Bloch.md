# Elizabeth Balashoff Bloch Markle

## October 1885, Alaska – May 1920, Seldovia, Alaska

**Elisaveta Elizabeth Balashoff** was born about in 1984 or 1885 on the
Kenai Peninsula. She married **Adam Bloch** in 1902 when she was about
17 and he was about 61 years old. She was married to her first husband,
Adam Bloch, on 9 Sep 1900 at Saint Nicholas Chapel (aka Russian Orthodox
Church) in Seldovia, Alaska by Reverend Ivan E. Bartnovsky. They had 4
children, daughters Susan BLOCH English (1904-1986), Mary BLOCH,
Fredrika "Rika" BLOCH Risoff (1906-1998) and son Adam Phillip BLOCH
(1914-2000).

Adam Bloch died in 1915, and on November 13, 1916 Elizabeth married
**Harry Alfred Markle**, in Seldovia. . She and her daughter **Elizabeth
Bessie Markle** (1917-1921) are buried in the old Seldovia Hillside
Cemetery near Main Street.

By her second husband she had two known children: 1) **Elizabeth
"Bessie" MARKLE**; and 2) "Baby" MARKLE. Her only grandchildren came
from her eldest three known children. Her death certificate indicates
that she died in Anchorage of a puerperal infection, i.e., puerperal
sepsis, a condition that arises from childbirth, and that she had been
treated for this, presumably after having been taken to Anchorage, from
5 May to 11 May 1920. The condition was indicated as having existed for
14 days. Her death certificate also indicates that she was buried in
Anchorage on 13 May 1920, but this is believed to be erroneous, as she
and both of her husbands lived in Seldovia, her first husband is buried
in the Seldovia Hillside Cemetery, and her own marker is in that
Hillside Cemetery as well.

After her death Harry moved back to California and Elizabeth’s children
were taken in by their half-siblings from Adam Bloch’s first marriage,
the Johansen and Simmons families.
