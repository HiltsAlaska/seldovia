|                      |                      | was unable to do so  |
|                      |                      | owing to the absence |

|                      |                      | that the evidence    |
|                      |                      | shows that Coffey    |
|                      |                      | was the agent of the |
|                      |                      | insurer; that he     |

|                      |                      | the omission of      |

**Herr*v.*Underwriters at Lloyds of London**

No. Sel. 5023.

May 8, 1951.

McCutcheon Nesbett, Anchorage, Alaska, for plaintiffs.

Davis Renfrew, Anchorage, Alaska, for defendant.

FOLTA, District Judge.

Plaintiffs seek to recover for the loss of an airplane under a policy
insuring it for \$6700, its full value, less \$50 deductible, and
depreciation at the rate or 20% per annum.

The policy, issued May 7, 1947, for one year, names the plaintiff \"Dick
Miller, doing business as the Seldovia Air Service\", as the insured.
The plaintiffs were partners doing business in that name at Seldovia,
about 150 miles from Anchorage, and it appears to be uncontradicted that
it was their intention that the policy should be issued in the names of
both. The insurance was procured, contemporaneously with and as a part
of the sale, by the seller of the plane, the Arnold Air Service of
Anchorage, through Ed Coffey of Anchorage, an insurance broker. Title
was reserved under a conditional sales contract, defendant\'s Exhibit
\"D\", executed by both of the plaintiffs, in which they were named as
the buyers. It was not shown how the omission of plaintiff Herr\'s name
from the policy occurred, but since the plaintiffs were required under
the conditional sales contract to pay the cost of insurance to the
seller, it may be presumed that the omission was that of the Arnold Air
Service or of Coffey, Neither Arnold nor Coffey, however, was produced
as a witness and the failure to produce them was not accounted for at
the trial.

Payments on the plane were completed September 15, 1947, on which date
the plaintiff Herr bought Miller\'s interest in the partnership and sold
the plane and other property, including the unexpired term of the
insurance, to one Henington, under a conditional sales contract,
defendant\'s Exhibit \"A\". Neither of these transactions was reported
to the insurer and it is not contended that the insurer had any
knowledge thereof, actual or constructive. More than \$4000 had been
paid on the purchase price by Henington when, on January 30, 1948, the
plane disappeared from its ramp on the shore of Seldovia Harbor. Some
time later a wing float, identified as from that type of plane, was
brought to Seldovia and it was reported that it had washed ashore about
10 miles from Seldovia. The plaintiff testified that on several
occasions after purchasing the plane he visited Anchorage and attempted
to ascertain the whereabouts of the policy in order to examine its
provisions, but that in each instance he was unable to do so owing to
the absence of Arnold and, hence, knew nothing of the omission of his
name from the policy until after the loss occurred.

Since the plaintiff Herr continued to operate the business after its
dissolution and is the only one beneficially interested in the outcome
of this action he will hereinafter be referred to as the plaintiff.

Plaintiff strenuously argues that the evidence shows that Coffey was the
agent of the insurer; that he knew that plaintiff was the other partner
of the firm and that his ordering the policy in the name of Miller
alone, or failure to detect the omission of Herr\'s name from the
application or policy is chargeable to his principal. Aside from the
fact that the evidence is wholly insufficient to establish agency, the
case turns, in my opinion, on other considerations. The questions
presented are:

\(1\) May the policy be treated as reformed so as to include
plaintiff\'s name as one of the insured?

\(2\) Was there a transfer of \"the interest of the insured\" in
violation of the terms of the policy?

\(3\) Was the loss of the plane within the coverage of the policy?

From the fact that the plane was insured for its full value it may be
inferred that it was the intention of the parties that not only the
entire ownership interest in the plane be covered, but that the owners
be named as the insured. Through oversight or inadvertence, however,
only one of the partners was named as the insured, although the full
premium of \$787.25 was paid by the partnership. A mistake of this kind,
even though it may appear to be unilateral, is, nevertheless, held to be
mutual. Great American Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 4 Cir., [[25 F.2d 847,

Accordingly, I find that the omission of plaintiff\'s name from the
policy was the result of a mutual mistake, which warrants a reformation
of the policy to conform to the intention of the partners and treatment
of it as so reformed. Great American Ins. Co. v. Johnson, supra, [[25

The contention that the contract of sale of the interest of plaintiff in
the plane to Henington voided the policy is based on paragraph (f) of
the exclusions, which provides that the certificate does not apply, \"to
loss or damage which occurs after a transfer, during the Certificate
period, of the interest of the Insured in the aircraft without the
written consent of the Underwriters\".

It should be noted that the provision quoted is directed against the
transfer of \"the interest\" of the insured. This would appear to
exclude, by implication, transfer of anything less than the entire
interest.

Defendant, however, contends that the transaction in question
constituted a present sale of the plaintiff\'s entire interest. In view
of the fact, however, that there was no transfer of title, the
transaction amounted to no more than a transfer of a part of the
owner\'s interest. Such a transaction, of course, is sufficient to void
a policy containing a provision prohibiting \"any change of title,
interest or possession, or providing that the interest of the, owner
shall be no less than \"sole and unconditional ownership\" and, indeed,
it may be plausibly argued that in view of the object of such provisions
to insure the continued interest of the named insured in protecting and
safeguarding the insured property, as well as to limit indemnification
of losses to those sustained by the insured only, the term here under
consideration should be construed to include the transfer of any
interest. I am inclined to the view, however, that where the language
used is that of the insurer and is, moreover, not ambiguous, there is no
room for construction and no reason to invoke the rule that terms of
doubtful import will be construed against the insurer and, hence, I am
of the opinion that the term \"the interest\" does not include the
transfer of anything less than the entire interest of the insured and
that, therefore, this particular provision of the policy was not
violated. Morrison\'s Admr. v. Tennessee Marine Fire Insurance Co., 18
Mo. 262, 59 Am.Dec. 299; Grable v. German Ins. Co., 32 Neb. 645, 49 N.W.
713, 715.

The plane disappeared from the ramp during the night of January 30,
1948. The defendant argues that the loss could have been occasioned by
malicious mischief, sabotage, intentional injury or destruction,
conversion, embezzlement or concealment, all of which are specified in
exclusion \"b\" of the policy. I am of the opinion, however, that these
are matters of defense with the burden of proof on the defendant, who
submitted no evidence following an adverse ruling on its motion to
dismiss. While the evidence as to the manner in which the plane was lost
is unsatisfactory, it may be reasonably inferred that it was improperly
moored and lost in consequence thereof, and, therefore, I find that the
loss is within the coverage of the policy.

I am of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the face
value of the policy, Dubin Paper Co. v. Insurance Co., [[361 Pa.
