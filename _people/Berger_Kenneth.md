# Kenneth Berger

## June 5, 1957, Anchorage, Alaska – July 9, 1966, Seldovia, Alaska

**Kenneth "Kenny" Berger**, was born in Anchorage, Alaska on June 5,
1957 to Merle Berger and Lillian Hojnacke. Merle and Lillian came to
Alaska from South Dakota in 1955, with the US Army. The family moved to
Seldovia in 1959 and left in 1968.

Kenny was one of seven siblings born to Merle and Lillian during their
time in Alaska. Merle had his own welding shop "Bergie’s Welding & Cold
Storage". While he could weld just about anything anyone needed, his
speciality was making king crab pots. He says he constructed tens of
thousands of those pots for numerous fishermen and boat operators during
his time in Seldovia. He also made a couple of scale models of the pots,
one of which he donated to the Seldovia Village Tribe’s museum in 2019.

Kenny was only 9 years old when he drowned while jumping from one
fishing boat to another in the Seldovia harbor in 1966. He was
discovered missing and it was a week before his body was found. The
family left Seldovia not long after that, but in 2019 they honored the
memory of Kenny by having a granite rock engraved with his name and
placed on his grave. He is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery, Plot
\#206.
