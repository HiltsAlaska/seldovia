# Bowen Family

**The many Bowen family members in Seldovia originate in Alaska from
David C. Bowen who was born in Maine in 1816 and died in Kodiak in 1888.
There is no record of him being in Alaska before his death, so he was
probably visiting his son Captain Henry Richard Bowen when he died in
1866. He is buried in the Old American Cemetery there.**

# Captain Henry Richard Bowen

## 1853, Gloucester, Massachusetts --(At Sea) Seldovia, Alaska

**David Bowen's son, Henry Richard BOWEN was born in
Massachusetts in 1853. In 1880 a salting station of the Western Fur and
Trading Company of San Francisco, operated at Karluk with Captain Bowen
of Saint Paul (Kodiak) as the local superintendent. They also maintained
a saltery at Kasilof.** At one time he was in charge of all the Northern
Commercial Company stores from Yakatat to Dutch Harbor. **Bowen believed
that the opportunities for fishing on Kodiak Island were exceptional. He
told a government official that "fishermen with a limited amount of
capital can establish themselves most readily in a lucrative business on
Kodiak Island...". Bowen returned to Gloucester several times after
moving to Alaska, but no amount of persuasion on his part could induce
any of the New England fishermen to move to Alaska. He married [Vavara
(Barbara) Annie NAUMOFF in Kodiak and had 9 children:
Rufus, Florence, Lydia, Elizabeth, Harriet, Fred, Barbara, Ollie and
David. Mrs. Bowen was "the Russian woman who showed Mother how to make
those wonderful fish pies the Russians called "perog", and the Bowens
were anxious for the schoolroom in St. Paul to be finished so they too
could send their children to school, Rufus, Ollie and David had gone to
school in Kodiak." *From Humboldt to Kodiak* by Fred Roscoe, 1992**

The 38 ton 60 foot schooner ***Seventy-Six*** departed Woody Island
December 11, 1895 with six crewmen and one passenger aboard. It was
bound for Kayak Island, continuing on to Prince William Sound on a
trading voyage. The vessel disappeared with all hands. The
***Seventy-Six*** was owned by the North American Commercial Company
whose principal station was at Woody Island. Weather was fair when the
vessel departed the island but deteriorated into a terrific northerly
gale soon after. Friends of the ***Seventy-Six*** crew reported their
concern that the vessel had no extra sails and that those they were
using were not in good condition and may not be able to withstand a
storm. Lost with the ***Seventy-Six*** were Captain Henry R. Bowen (45)
of Massachusetts and North American Commercial Company's foreman who was
in charge of the expedition, and six others. Captain Bowen left behind a
wife and 9 children. The steamer Dora reported that wreckage from the
schooner drifted ashore near Kodiak Island. **The rest of the Bowen
family lived in Kodiak until Mt. Katmai erupted in 1912.**

# Rufus Bowen, Jr.

## October 22, 1879, Alaska -- September 1953, Alaska

**Rufus Bowen** was born in Kodiak October 22, 1879 and
came to Seldovia after the Novarupta eruption in 1912. He built a cabin
where the Harbor's Edge is located and grazed horses in a pasture
located where the current SVT building stands. Later he lived in a cabin
on the edge of the Russian Orthodox Church Cemetery.

March 1919 - ARRIVAL OF PILGRIM MARKS FIRST MOVEMENT IN ANCHORAGE HARBOR
THIS YEAR. With the arrival here at 12.40 o\'clock p. m., March 9 from
Seldovia of the gasoline power boat Pilgrim, the first movement of craft
in Anchorage harbor was recorded for the 1919 season. The movement this
year was almost a month earlier than in 1918 when the sailing April 11
of the gasoline power boat Swan for Knik marked the first water
activity. The Pilgrim, with a cargo of six tons of fresh eggs, fresh
fruit and butter consigned to J. J. Chisholm and with four persons
aboard of her, left Seldovia the fore-noon of March 6. She encountered
no ice until after she had passed the forelands, which are about six
hours\' run from Anchorage. After having passed the forelands, she
sighted ice near to her but it did not interfere with her navigation and
required no attention at all until she was off Fire Island. Then she had
to take into account the ebb and fIow of quite a field of slush ice, but
she lost no time on account of it. She landed here near the dock of the
Alaskan Engineering Commission and was unloaded with-out difficulty. The
Pilgrim on her voyage from Seldovia was in charge of Pilot Rufe Bowen.
Her owner, Captain William Nelson, was aboard of her. She is scheduled
to leave Anchorage on her return to Seldovia late this afternoon or
to-morrow.

POWER BOAT PILGRIM LEAVES ON HER RETURN VOYAGE TO SELDOVIA. With three
persons aboard, the power boat Pilgrim left Anchorage at 2 o\'clock p.
m. March 12, for Seldovia. Those on her were Captain William Nelson, her
owner; Rufe Bowen, her pilot, and William Murray. The Pilgrim was the
first craft to put into Anchorage harbor this year, having arrived March
9 with six tons of fresh eggs, fresh fruit and butter from Seldovia.
