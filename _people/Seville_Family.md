showed in all that he did, including basketball and baseball as a
teenager, stacking logs, longline gear and crab pots as a young adult.
He was always willing to listen or help whoever asked or needed. He was
polite and well mannered. He was always making sure to acknowledge
others. Keith was a big hearted man who loved to spend time with
children with a jolly and magical smile. Hands of a giant, yet gentle
when needed. He was never able to sneak up on anyone due to his
boisterous voice and charm. "
