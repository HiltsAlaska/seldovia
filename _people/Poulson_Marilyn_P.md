**Marilyn P. Polson** was the wife of **Pete Polson**, who worked at the Wakefield Cannery and also owned the Admiral Theater. He bought the original Admiral Theater on the boardwalk from Jack C. Anderson, Jr.  The theater was destroyed along with all of the other buildings on the boardwalk, as a result urban renewal after the 1964 earthquake.  Pete rebuilt the theater on Seldovia Street across from the City Office building. He and Marilyn lived upsairs and had two bull dogs, and at some point one of them made history when it bit Pete and took a chunk out of his cheek.   The Admiral Theater closed down when a TV tower was built and Seldovians began to own their own televisions. The building later became Central Suites.

Marilyn died in Seldovia on June 5, 1963 and is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in Plot #203.
