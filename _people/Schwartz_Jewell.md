**Jewell Helen LITTLE Schwartz** was born July 2, 1923 in Clarkrange, Tennessee, a descendent of first Tennessee Governor John Sevier. As a young wife she followed her husband Harry D Schwartz on their first adventure to Alaska from Dayton, Ohio in 1946. From that time they raised their family in Anchorage, a homestead near Anchor Point then Seward, and then later Seldovia, Anchorage again, and finally Dillingham, Alaska.

While husband Harry served in law enforcement, Jewell’s career was as a store clerk in Seldovia in banking as an associate in Anchorage, then as a department manager in Phoenix. The couple raised six children, three of whom remained in Alaska.

Jewell passed away February 24, 2013 in Phoenix, Arizona and is survived by her remaining immediate family, daughters Anita Parker and Marianne Schwartz of Phoenix, daughters Janice Knight and Cathy Kincaid of Anchorage, son Hank Schwartz of Wichita, her sister Jean Underwood of Farmington and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, nephews and nieces throughout the United States. She was preceded in death by her husband, Hank, her son Michael, her parents Herbert and Mary, her brother John, and her sister Barbara.

Memorial services were held March 10, 2013 at 2 pm St Stephen’s Episcopal Church at 56th Street and Oak in Phoenix, Arizona. Next summer her children sprinkled their parent’s ashes over the Kenai Peninsula. Cathy is married to Jim Kincaid, formerly of Seldovia, and he is the brother of Margaret Kincaid. If anyone remembers this family and wants to somehow honor their memory, please donate a book to the Seldovia Library in their name.
