# Samuel Campbell

## March 12, 1878 -- Newfoundland, Canada -- 1946, Seldovia, Alaska

**Samuel Campbell** was born on March 12, 1878, on Little
Bay Island in Newfoundland Canada, to Alban and Martha Campbell. He had
numerous brothers and sisters who settled in both Canada and the U.S.

He and his older brother, **John Robert Campbell** (1873-1966)
immigrated to Eagle, Alaska, via Dawson, Canada in 1905. In 1910 they
were living near Tofty, a mining settlement with a population of 600,
near Manley Hot Springs, that is now a ghost town. They listed
themselves as miners and prospectors when registering for the draft in
WWI from the Ruby district. In 1918-1819 they were living in Long, a
settlement on the Yukon River, 30 miles from Ruby, where Sam was
postmaster and had a business, Campbell & Co., selling general
merchandise. While his brother continued to prospect in the Ruby/Nulato
area for the rest of his life, Sam Campbell was living in Multnomah
Oregon in 1930, working as a laborer on the railroad. By 1940 he was in
Seldovia, working as a dock hand. He lived in Seldovia when he
registered for the World War II draft in 1942 at the age of 64. He died
in Seldovia October 22, 1946. He is buried in the Seldovia City
Cemetery, Plot \#35.
