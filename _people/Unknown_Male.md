**Male   Unknown** is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in plot 146.  

The body of an unidentified white man was found on the beach at Niggerhead Point near Seldovia. He hands were missing and most of the head.  The back part of the skull appeared to be fractured.  R. Wm. Kirby of Seldovia expressed the opinion that the body had been in the water apparently three and one half months.  The doctor also estimated the man’s age was about 35 years.  He was a small man with very small feet, well-dressed in a blue serge suit and shirt.  A pair of lenseless glasses were found on the body, also a fountain pen and a box of snuff.  There were no identification marks whatever upon the body.  The body did not appear to be that of a fisherman, but a man that had followed some other occupation.  The coroner’s jury brought in a verdict of death from unknown causes. Source: Fairbanks News Miner, September 13, 1938
