**RAY HERBERT SWANEY** was born January 6, 1903 in Washington. He first married **May Burnett** in Oregon in 1942. He later married [**Marie Anderson**](./Anderson_Marie.md), the widow of [**Sigurd Halvorsen**](./Halvorsen_Sigard.md). 

The family says "In the long absences of Sigard leading up to the time of his death it is possible that a secret affair developed between the two. Ray Herbert Sweney appears to be for all intents and purposes, the biological father of Patricia Lee, but because it was not proper to make this known, a possible plot may have developed to invent a story about the nature of her real father.

Ray's wife Marie, despite her difficult life, managed to outlive both of her husbands. Ray and Marie were able to enjoy about four years of married life together before he passed away.

Naming patterns suggest that the middle name Ray may have been a namesake for Danny Ray, Patricia's son. The name Lee may also have been a popular name with other Sweny's found in Alaska. Patricia or Patsy, Marie's last child was named a traditional Irish name and not a Norwegian or Russian name like other family members. While all these things are speculative and possibly circumstantial they may have some basis.

When Ray died, he willed his home and property to Marie. When she died, she willed it to her daughter Patricia and no one else. For a while, Patricia rented the home out to some locals. One day the oil tank outside caught on fire and the house exploded barely allowing the Men to escape. Up to that time, the locals called the place where the house stood "Halvorsen Hill" for all the children who were born there. Patricia Lee is the only known child of Ray Herbert Swaney."

Ray died March 13, 1957 and is buried in Plot #11 in the Seldovia City Cemetery.
