**Father Peter Dobrovolsky**, father of [**Paraskovia Dobrovolsky Rohde**](./Dobrovolsky_Parascovia.md), may have been a Russian Orthodox priest in Kodiak and Seldovia. 

He was first buried in the old Russian Orthodox Cemetery near the beach, but his grave was part of the re-burial in the City Cemetery as part of the urban renewal project after the 1964 earthquake. He is buried next to his daughter in the Seldovia City Cemetery in plot #117, under a stone box with the word "Faher" on top.
