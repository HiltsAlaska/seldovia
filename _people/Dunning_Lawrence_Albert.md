**LAWRENCE ALBERT DUNNING** was born September 18, 1868 in Fremont, Ohio to
Edwin and Charlotte Lawrence Dunning. The family moved to Tennessee and
Washington states. In 1930 Lawrence was single, living with his brother
Ralph in Seldovia.

In 1933, he married **Eunice SIMARD**. Eunice was born in Montana and
had come to Seldovia by 1930 where she was living with her mother, Alma
and brother, Francis, at the home of John Coburn. John was a cook at a
restaurant and Alma also worked there. Three children were born to
Lawrence and Eunice in Seldovia.

Larry also owned the boat "Seward" that he sometimes used to haul coal
from the Homer side of Kachemak Bay over to Seldovia.

In the mid 1920s there was a sawmill on Powder Island that was owned by
partners Lawrence Dunning and Archie Keller. The mill was powered by a
steam boiler fed with slabs of wood.

At the time of his death on March 25, 1940, Lawrence was a janitor at
the school.
