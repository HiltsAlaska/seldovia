# Robert Bruce Markle

## 1842 – Monticello, Indiana – May 28, 1920, Alaska

He was born in about 1842 in Monticello, White County, Indiana. He had
nine known full siblings and two half-brothers (from his father's second
marriage). He was married to Minnesota "Minnie" Elizabeth Foster on 11
Jun 1879 at Cottoneva (now Rockport), Ten Mile Township, Mendocino
County, California by George W. Claxton, Justice of the Peace. Minnie
was a daughter of William McFadden and Sarah Ann Charlotte (Murphy)
Foster, survivors of the Donner Party. Robert and Minnie had five known
children: 1) Robert Bruce Markle, Jr.; 2) Elizabeth M. (Markle)
Richardson; 3) Henry-Harry Alfred Markle; 4) Charles-Carl Oliver Markle;
and 5) Margarite Love Markle. Any surviving biological descendants would
come from their daughter Elizabeth. Sometime prior to 24 May 1910 he and
his wife were separated and presumably divorced, as he was indicated to
be a widower in the 1910 Census enumerated on that date. His wife was
similarly indicated to be a widow in the 1920 Census enumerated on 6 Jan
1920, which was four months prior to his death.  
  
Susan E. (Bloch) English, a step-daughter of his son Henry-Harry Alfred
Markle, noted before her death that she knew him to be buried in
Hillside Cemetery. His name is also engraved on a marker in the Markle
family plot at Rose Memorial Park in Fort Bragg, California, but it
appears that it was added by one or more of his children as a
cenotaph.  
  
His obituary in the 30 Jun 1920 edition of the Fort Bragg \[, Mendocino
County, CA\] Advocate reads, "R. Bruce Markle died in Alaska May 28,
1920 at the age of 78. He had once been the Mendocino County surveyor
and a civil engineer with the Union Lumber Company in Fort Bragg. The
railroad tunnel at Fort Bragg was built under his supervision."
