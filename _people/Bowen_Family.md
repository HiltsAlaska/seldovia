# Bowen Family

The many Bowen family members in Seldovia originate in Alaska from
David C. Bowen who was born in Maine in 1816 and died in Kodiak in 1888.
There is no record of him being in Alaska before his death, so he was
probably visiting his son Captain Henry Richard Bowen when he died in 1866. 
He is buried in the Old American Cemetery there.
