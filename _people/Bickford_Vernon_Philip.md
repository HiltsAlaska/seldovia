*Anchorage, Alaska (AP) Two Seldovia fishermen survived a midnight shipwreck in the remote and chilly waters of Chugach Bay by swimming ashore and walking 70 rugged miles home.  Buddy Bickford of Anchorage, along with crewmember Dean Hanson, were headed from Seldovia south around the horn of the Kenai Peninsula to Port Dick Monday in the 6-foot shrimp boat Angel Marie when high winds hit, Seldovia Harbormaster Penny Rich said.  Winds reaching 75 to 80 mph blew the boat onto the rocks, destroying the vessel, she said.  After swimming to shore, the two worked until late Tuesday to radio for help but were unsuccessful.  Later in the day they began walking back to Seldovia.  They arrived late Wednesday evening.  They suffered no serious injuries.*
