# Elxnit Family

**The many Elxnit family members in Seldovia originate from Henry
Richard Bowen who was born in Massachusetts in 1853 and died in Kodiak
in 1895. He married Annie Naumoff in Kodiak and had 9 children: Rufus,
Florence, Lydia, Elizabeth, Harriet, Fred, Barbara, Ollie and David.**

# Alexsandra Potorochin Elxnit

**[March 16, 1885, Kodiak, Alaska -- September 1953,
Alaska**

Alexsandra's family, the Potorochins, lived for ten years in Eagle
Harbor near Saltery Cove on Kodiak Island. According to the birth
registry book of the Holy Resurrection Russian Orthodox Cathedral of
Kodiak, Alexandra was born in Kodiak on March 16, 1885. Alexsandra's
father was Nicolas Mikailov Potorochin who married Martha Egorieff
(Egorev, Igoroff). After the Katmai eruption in 1912, the Potorochin
family were transported to Iliamna on the Revenue Cutter Manning, then
to Ninilchik and later settled in Seldovia. Alexsandra's mother Martha
later married Nicholas Romanov Fomin, a Creole and lay reader in the
Russian Orthodox Church. Mr. Fomin also worked as the store manager for
the Alaska Commercial Company in Eagle Harbor. Alexsandra became
Nicholas Fomin's step-daughter.

Alexsandra, known as Shura, married first on November 24, 1902, Harry
(Rufus) Grenieff, Russian-born though of Finnish descent. As was custom,
the church arranged the marriage between Rufus and Alexandra. The
Grenieff's had two children, Nicholas born November 3, 1903 in Kodiak,
and Dora, born on the Steamship DORA on November 2, 1905, while the ship
traveled between Seldovia and Kodiak. Rufus died in Kodiak from
pneumonia at an early age and Alexandra later married **Aleksandr
Elxnit** who was born in 1867.

Her daughter Dora lived in Kodiak until 1913 when she moved to Seldovia
and attended the Seldovia Territorial School. She married **[Axel
Ursin** of Seldovia and the couple had four children:
Rayder, Laura, Norman and Eleanor.
