**GARY R. ALLEN, "TUFFY"** was born in Oregon in 1955 to Doug and Shirley (Threw) Allen. The family moved to Seldovia when his father came to work on the logging operation at Jackalof Bay. Gary drowned in Seldovia harbor on May 2, 1975, and is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in Plot # 247. His death added impetus to the community effort to include a swimming pool in the new Seldovia school.
