**Eric Nordenson** was born on March 23, 1944 in Seldovia to Carl and Grace Mary LLOYD Nordenson. After graduating from Seldovia High School in 1961, he attended college in Moscow, Idaho, for two years. He then enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He served for 6O years and completed three tours in Vietnam.

After his time in the Navy, he relocated to Illinois. While there, he worked in road construction. He built many strong, lifelong friendships. He returned to his hometown of Seldovia in 1979. He spent the following years in commercial fishing, working road construction, and as an engineer on a response vessel based in Valdez.

He had a fierce love for his hometown. He served several years on the Seldovia City Council. He had pride in his community and strong interest in retaining Old Seldovia  values.

Family and friends were very important to him. He enjoyed visiting and spending time with his many close friends. He held a deep respect for his elders. He loved to hunt, fish and spend time outdoors. No matter how successful the hunt or fishing was, he always shared his catch with friends and family. Fourth of July barbecues at his house were an annual tradition.

No matter the subject, he always had an opinion â€“ and it was right!
