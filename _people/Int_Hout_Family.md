# Int-Hout FAMILY

**The Int-Hout **in Seldovia began with two brothers, "**Tuggle**" and
"**Pierre**", who arrived in 1946. Tuggle said ""I had an uncle that
was up here in 1917, during World War I, and he used to tell us some
wild stories," said Pierre Int-Hout. "My brother and I came up to see if
it was true." Tuggle and Pierre were born in Garland, Illinois to John
and Garland Int-hout. Although John was born in Illinois his father and
mother were born in the Netherlands and immigrated early in their
marriage. Both Tuggle and Pierre served in WWII. Their trip to Alaska
ended up in becoming lifetime adventures.
