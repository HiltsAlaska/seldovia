# JACK THOMAS

## February 2, 1931, California – October 12, 2016, Seldovia, Alaska

Jack Thomas came to Seldovia in 1968.

Jack had worked for Jack Hopkins and Lloyd Wheeler on logging operations
in California. In the mid-1960s logging operations in California got
scarce, so Jack hoped on a plane to Anchorage without even telling his
wife. He found a job putting in a water line in King Cove. Then he
returned to California and he and Jack Hopkins flew to Alaska in
Hopkins’ Luscombe, using the Alaska Highway as their road map. They
got logging jobs working out at Jackolof Bay before the road was put in,
so Bob Gruber flew them out from Seldovia every day. He and his wife
Marge and children lived in a trailer park there, and his daughters rode
a school bus into Seldovia every school day.

After a couple of years the logging operation finished but Jack and his
family were happy to live in Seldovia. King Crab fishing was a booming
operation, so he went to work for Josie Carlough, fishing for crab on
the 78 ft "Primus". Johnny Saracoff and Roy Hansen also fished with
them. Jack was the "engineer". That lasted one season because they
caught all the fish\!

JACK THOMAS: One day we -- I think we went out a little earlier than we
-- Jimmy did. And we just loaded that boat right down. Come in, unloaded
at the cannery, and went back out and loaded it again…... It was real
good and then it -- it -- we just caught 'em all, that's all. Killed it
right off. Oh, there was spurts later on that was pretty good.

He bought the Hag’s Neck property from Josie’s sister in 1970. There was
a little shack there but they decided to build something more prominent.
He built the shop first. The timbers in the house used to be part of an
old dock, near where the pavilion is now. Jack recognized the fine old
Douglas fir under all of the creosote and had the equipment to move
them, and clean them up to make beautiful house beams.

Jack also had some property on the way up Red Mountain. He had a mining
claim at Red Mountain and helped develop and maintain the road. He was
given an old connex trailer that had been used at Kasitsna Bay lab
before they built the buildings. He towed it up to the site and over the
years there were some wild Fourth of July parties held out there, with
fireworks and even the firing of Rick Harsness’ cannon.

Jack taught himself to weld and his welding and mechanical services were
in high demand in the community. Unlike many Seldovians he never owned a
boat – he preferred to live on the land. He also worked as a heavy
equipment operator around Alaska and for the oil industry. Jack owned a
special piece of property on the Seldovia Slough, called Hag’s Nook.
