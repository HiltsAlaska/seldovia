**Frank S.** **Gruber** was born August 1870 in Marion, Ohio to John J.
Gruber and Martha Sayers Gruber. His family moved to Shawnee, Kansas
soon after that, and there Frank married Leila Matthews (1880-?). They
had 3 children: Elizabeth Gruber Duchard/Moisant/Brown, (1901-1995),
Florence Gruber Tenney (1903-1986), and Grace GRUBER Burress
(1904-1990). In 1902 Frank, Leila and Elizabeth moved to Los Angeles,
California where the other two girls were born.

At some point before 1910 Frank left the family and headed north. Leila
is listed alone with the children in 1910, as married, but as a widow in
1920-1940 census records and in Inglewood California City Directory for
1938 she lists herself as widow of F.S. Gruber.

In 1930 Frank is listed in Valdez, Alaska census as divorced. He was a
laborer at the Beatson Copper Mine on Latouche Island. The mine closed
on November 29, 1930, so perhaps it was soon after that that Frank moved
on to Seldovia. On August 2, 1939 Frank died in Seldovia and the cause
of death listed on the death certificate is "Chronic valvular heart
disease". He was 70 years old.
