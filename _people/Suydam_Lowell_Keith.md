# Lowell Keith Suydam

**January 27, 1953, Chignik Lagoon, Alaska – December 2, 1987, Seldovia,
Alaska**

**Lowell Keith Suydam** was born to **\[Floyd Lowell Suydam\]** and
**Stella BRUN Suydam** on January 27, 1953 in Chignik Lagoon. He spent
most of his life in Seldovia, having graduated from Susan B. English
School in 1972. He commercial fished in Chignik Lagoon all his life.
Starting as a young boy, Lowell learned from his father, Floyd, and
became the successful captain of his father's fishing vessel, the
Stellor. Lowell also worked for the Seldovia Village Tribe as the
computer expert and was the "go-to" guy whenever anything technical was
amiss, not working, new or broken.

It was a whirlwind romance as Lowell and Marcella met in Seldovia in
December 1983, became engaged on Valentine's Day 1984 and were married
at the Seldovia Bible Chapel eight months later, on Oct. 13, 1984.
Lowell put his wife and children above all else in his life, doing
whatever he could to ensure their thriving future through both financial
support and his own wisdom and generous love. One of his greatest joys
in life was his home filled with his children's gifts of music. He is
buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery Plot \#554.
