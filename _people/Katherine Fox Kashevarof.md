**Katherine FOX Kashevarof**, was born May 6, 1906, in
Unga. Her father, Thomas Fox, was from England. Thomas was a member of
the Roman Catholic Church and served in His Majesty\'s Navy in England.
He emigrated on the sailing ship SERVIA, from Sydney, Australia,
arriving in America on 1 June 1901 in the port of San Francisco,
California. He married Emma Gardner in Aleutians East, Alaska and they
became the parents of nine children. Tom had a tattoo ring on left small
finger. He was a fox fur trapper in the Shumagin Islands and a member of
the Unga Unit of the Alaska Territorial Guard. Emma and the children
moved to Unalaska in the early 1930s.

Katherine married **Ernest VINBERG** in 1924 and had five
children: Esther, Ernest, Hubert, Emil and Don Vinberg. In 1934, she
married **Andrew KASHEVAROF** and had five more children:

She and her family lived in Unalaska during World War II. On June 3,
1942, the Japanese bombed their home in Unalaska. The family, along with
the other villagers, was evacuated to White Salmon, Wash., until 1944.
When they returned to Unalaska, they found their home in a shambles. Her
husband died in 1945. From 1948-50, Mrs. Kashevarof owned and operated
Kate\'s Kozy Kitchen, a restaurant and bakery in Unalaska. The family
moved to Seldovia in 1951, and Katherine clerked in Morris\'s General
Store, and worked in Wakefield Seafoods crab plant. In 1975, a new
108-foot crab fishing vessel owned by Parks & Ringstad was christened
the \'\'Katie K.\'\' in her honor. In 1996, she was named CITC\'s Elder
of the Year and a large 90th birthday party was held in her honor. She
