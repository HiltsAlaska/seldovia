**Konstantine Sorokovikoff "Konste"**  was born January 24, 1871 in Kodiak.  He married Sarafina and had children Sarafina (1903), Nick (1905), and Andrew (1908). He was a Dena'ina-speaking lay song leader who grew up in Kenai and was in charge of a chapel in Seldovia in the 1920s and 1930s. He accompanied the missionary Paul Shadura as an interpreter between 1908 and 1914.  A phrase ("my own Indian song leader") casually uttered by Shadura regarding this Creole-cultural broker reveals the level of Constantine's entrenchment into Dena'ina culture. The US Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) could not figure out how to categorize him in their official rosters: on the one hand, Constantine was involved in local subsistence activities, and on the other hand, he was performing chapel services.  As a result, in their 1934 roster of Seldovia residents, the BIA labeled him as a "second priest of Seldovia".
