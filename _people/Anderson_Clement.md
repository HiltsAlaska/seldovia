RAISE FINE VEGETABLES AT HUDGIN SPRINGS

Sample Consignment Arrives at Rampart Which Rivals the Product of Karshner's Springs -- Sanitarium Is Planned.

Clement Anderson and Gus Brown arrived last evening in a small boat direct from the Hudgin Hot Springs via Ray River, says the Rampart forum of recent date.

They brought down some samples of the turnips, beets and cabbages grown there this summer. The produce will compare with any grown at the Karshner Springs at Baker and Farrar excels any grown in the states. One of the turnips measures 23 inches in circumference and weighs over 6 pounds. The cabbage and beets are particularly fine, the former being firm and Chris and Wayne from 5 to 10 pounds.

Dr. Hudgin will have a boatload of produce on sale on the next trip down. The mammoth assortment brought this trip is on exhibition at the post office. The doctor is sending up a lot of chickens and will install several incubators which will operate by natural heat from the Hot Springs. Preparations are now being made to stock the farm next spring with sheep, cattle and hogs.

He will also ship his Marten and commence breeding them at the Springs. The doctor has been experimenting during the past year with the water of the Springs and finds it highly mineralized and valuable in rheumatism and skin diseases. He plans a sanitarium at the Springs.

25 miles of road will be constructed from the Springs to the Yukon and at that point--12 miles above the Pioneer coal mine--a small trading post and cold storage is planned. The beef, mutton, pork and other farm products will be shipped from this post. The doctor believes that a large trade can be worked up, and that a generous patronage is awaiting the man who can supply Yukon points with such native products.

 Clement is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in plot 105.5.
