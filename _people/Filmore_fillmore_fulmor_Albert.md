# Albert Filmore/Fillmore/Fulmor

## November 1850, Maine – February 13, 1919, Seldovia, Alaska

**Albert Filmore** was born in Maine in 1851. His father was born in
Massachusetts and mother in Nova Scotia, but there were a great many
Filmores in the US who descend from that Nova Scotia line.

It has to yet to be determined how he came to be known as "Captain
Filmore" by the time he came to live in Seldovia, Alaska just after the
turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. In the 1910 US Census, he was
living here as single farmer. At some point he filed on a government
homestead, consisting of 160 acres of land in Sections 31 and 32,
Township 8 South, Range 14 West, S. M. Alaska, which came to include a
portion of the townsite of Seldovia, as well as tracts of lands later
claimed by Joe Jones and Richard Morris (see story below).

Seldovia was first surveyed as a town site in 1927, when five tracts
were identified that included both sides of Seldovia Slough including
the little peninsula protecting the mouth of the slough, a small parcel
on the shore between the slough and the ROC school (USS 371, TractC),
and a tract encompassing all three ROC tracts as well as six groups of
Native houses. In between Seldovia Slough and the ROC school tract
federal surveyor Fred Dahlquist marked the "Fillmore Homestead," a claim
by Captain Albert Fillmore.

Why did the name suddenly become Fulmor instead of Fillmore? Many people
think it was just a spelling mistake, and it may have been, but the
mistake probably happened earlier in the family.

When he died on February 13, 1919, the terms of Albert Filmore’s will
bequeathed the homestead tract to a cousin, Bertha **Fulmor**, living in
Humboldt, California. His estate was probated in Alaska, and the final
decree was rendered July 3, 1932.

Bertha Fulmor made final proof in the United States Land Office July 23,
1930, on 91.86 acres of the original homestead, relinquishing a claim of
title to Lots 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of Section 31, which included a portion
of the townsite of Seldovia. Her title to the balance of the 160-acre
homestead, comprising 91.86 acres of land, was confirmed by the United
States Land Office. There’s actually an oft-cited California court case
"Hayter vs. Fulmor", that describes how Bertha tried to get W.R.
Hayter, to go from California to Seldovia to sell her property in 1940.
She didn’t tell him that she had relinquished claim to those lots and
insisted he must sell them before selling the larger parcel. When he
arrived in Seldovia and found that others claimed ownership to those
lots and she still refused to alter the terms of his contract, he sued
her for damages for fraud and won $2106. In 1949. Bertha Fulmor then
sold much of her land to Frank Raby, who by then owned H.S. Young
Mercantile Co. after he married H.S.’s widow, Winifred. In 1935 Frank
gave the land for the cemetery. Men volunteered to cut trees and brush,
fence the area and put up the front gate, pillars and signs.

Part of the original homestead, "Cap’s Hill" was later razed during the
Urban Renewal project following the 1964 earthquake. The US Army Corps
of Engineers and its contractors razed the structures in the intertidal
zone and filled it with material blasted from Cap’s Hill and the Fulmore
Homestead.

Susan Springer describes an incident that took place in 1909: "…..
Filmore was having a party and the liquor was flowing freely Two guests,
Captain Andrew Johnson and a man named Duffy, fell to arguing and then
exchanged blows, Captain Johnson apparently the aggressor. Duffy pulled
a knife and stabbed Johnson twice; once in the chest and once in the
right shoulder. There was no physician in Seldovia so Miss Van Vranken,
the sanitation nurse, was summoned. She dressed the wounds and sewed
them up and was credited with saving Johnson’s life. By the time a team
of Seward lawmen reached Seldovia, over a month had passed. Now it was
revealed that the knife wielding guest was not Duffy, but an elderly
gentleman named Mr. Markle. Because Capt. Johnson was identified as the
aggressor, attacking Markle without provocation, no charges were filed
in the case. This certainly differed from the original story and it was
becoming evident that Seldovia needed its own law enforcement official"
(p. 180-181)

Capt. Filmore was also interested in gardening. In 1902 he was quoted in
the Report on the US Dept. of Agriculture’s annual report: " I have
given some of the seeds to the natives to plant and I will show them how
to plant them. Some of them had very good gardens last year and this
year they will have even more and better gardens as they have received
more and better seeds."

When water lines were excavated at the base of a hill above the power
plant, Cap’s grave was found and reburied in about the same place. There
doesn’t seem to be any kind of marker there.
