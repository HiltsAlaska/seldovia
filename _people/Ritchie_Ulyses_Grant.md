**Ulysses  "U.S." Ritchie**  was born October 1868 in Chester, Pennsylvania into the Quaker family of Ceorge and Eliza Ritchie.  He came to Alaska on a ship and got off in Tyonke. For a time he worked with a government survey party and wound up in the Hope Sunrise Gold Strike, building log cabins for the miners. He made more money than the miners did and came to Seldovia, where he got a government lease on Yukon Island where he fox farmed. Fred Elvsaas related a story U.S. told about a Chinese man who lived here and wanted to sell his daughter to him, but being a Quaker he wouldn't do that.  After he married his first wife Annie and had children U.S. would tease George that he could have had a Chinese wife and might have looked very different.

The family is listed in the 1910 Alaska census records where he is living on Yukon Island, with his wife Annie and sons, [**GEORGE**](./Ritchie_George.md), Sam, and Jim.  Annie was born in Alaska. In 1920, only son George is listed with them. The other children may have succumbed to the influenza in 1918.

In 1921 U.S. applied for a post as US Postmaster in Seldovia, but failed to qualify.  U.S. married Mary Toco in 1925.   In 1930 U.S. is listed in Seldovia as a widower living with son George, also a widower; he is a carpenter and George is a fisherman.   In 1940 both U.S. and George are living together in Seldovia, and both are listed as widowers but I havenâ€™t found a record of a marriage for George.U.S.is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in plot 14.5.
