**Marvin Sylvester Swenson** was born in Holton, Michigan on December 31, 1891. His parents, Cristian and Lina Swenson owned a farm there, and his grandparents were from Norway. The family moved to Seattle, Washington sometime between 1900 and 1910, and there his father died of influenza in 1920.  

Marvin married Olga Johnson in Edmonds, Washington in 1917, and soon after registered for the WWI draft. He listed himself as a ship builder. Marvin and Olga had at least two children before divorcing. 

In 1928, at the age of 36, he married Pearl Robinson in Portland, Oregon.  At that time he gave his address as Makushin Bay, Alaska and listed his occupation as ship builder.

Marvin was living in Port Graham, Alaska and working in a cannery, when he met and married [**Jenny Moonin**](./Swenson_Jenny_Moonin.md).  Marvin adopted Jenny's two children from her earlier marriage, including [**David Swenson**](./Swenson_David.md) and  Catherine.  

Marvin died June 14, 1957 in Seldovia and is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in Plot #64, near Jenny and David.
