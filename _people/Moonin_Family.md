# MOONIN FAMILY

The **Moonin** name originates with the 1880s missionary **John
Moonin**. In the 1830s John Moonin (Munin) was born in San Francisco. He
was of Russian, American Indian, and Spanish ancestry. During the 1850s,
Moonin and his first wife moved to Kodiak Island. After she died, he
married Helen Medvidnikoff whose father was Russian and mother was
Aleut. Moonin and his new wife volunteered to do missionary work in
Seldovia during the 1860s. He was a lay reader and paid by the Russian
government to conduct the activities of the church, including services
and baptisms. Having lived in Seldovia only a short time, Moonin and his
wife moved to Nanwalek where they settled. One son of John and Helen
Moonin was Nicholas, born in 1874, who became an Orthodox priest and the
patriarch of Nanwalek until his death in 1972.
