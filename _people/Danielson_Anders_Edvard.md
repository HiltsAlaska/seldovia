**ANDERS EDVARD DANIELSON, "Ed"** was born in Sweden about 1875.  He immigrated to the United States about 1890.  He is listed in 1920 US Census in Kenai, as a laborer on the railroad, in 1930 in Seldovia as a general laborer and in 1940 in Seldovia with no occupation. There is no record of any marriages or children.  He died in Seldovia July 17, 1945. 

The first car brought to Seldovia was an old Dodge pickup.  It was owned by Ed Danielson and brought here in the 1930s.  He had to build the roads to drive it on. One of the roads is still existing today.  It is the one that runs from Main Street up past the hospital and Jack Englishâ€™s office. From: Jack  and Susan English interview, with students of Susan B. English School (1980)

Ed's truck also hauled coal, that was brought to Seldovia from Homer by barge, up from the beach to the school and other locations. 

Ed  is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in plot 154.
