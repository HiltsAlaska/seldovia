**ANDERS EDVARD DANIELSON, "Ed"** was born in Sweden and died in Seldovia July 1, 1945. 

The first car brought to Seldovia was an old Dodge pickup.  It was owned by Ed Danielson and brought here in the 1930s.  He had to build the roads to drive it on. One of the roads is still existing today.  It is the one that runs from Main Street up past the hospital and Jack Englishâ€™s office.

Jack's truck also hauled coal that was brought to Seldovia from Homer by barge up from the beach to the school and other locations. 

Ed  is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in plot 154.
