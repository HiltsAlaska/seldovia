# Annie BLOCH Christiansen

## October 11, 1871, California â€“ January 11, 1921, Seldovia, Alaska

Annie BLOCH was the daughter of Adam Bloch and his first wife, Anny-Anna
(Malakoff) Bloch, and was born at the Presidio of San Francisco. She
married Julius Christiansen in about 1894 in Alaska. He was born between
Nov 1855 and Nov 1859 in Norway. She is buried in the Seldovia Hillside
Cemetery near her father and step-mother.  
  
A notice in the 2 Aug 1930 edition of The Fairbanks Daily News Miner
reads, "DOING WELL IN NORWAY - Julius Christiansen, a resident of Alaska
for many years, is now a successful fox rancher in Norway, according to
the Seldovia Herald. Christiansen formerly resided at Seldovia and left
the Territory six years ago to establish a fox ranch in his native land.
He made his start in Alaska foxes and writes that he is prospering."
