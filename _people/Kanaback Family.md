# KANABACK Family

The **KANABACK** family in Alaska goes back at least to the late 1800s
when John Kaneback and his wife Eva/Eugenia had a family that lived on
the Kenai coast. It is probable that the original Kanaback was from
Russia and was part of the Russian fort established in Kodiak in the
early 1800s, but no documentation has been found to support this. John
was born in Kodiak, but Eugenia (who may have been his second wife) was
born in Seldovia. John had at least three sons, Gabriel, John, and
Walter. Gabriel's family is in English Bay/Nanwalek but Walter and his
family settled in Seldovia.
