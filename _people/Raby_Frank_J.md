**Francis John Raby, "Frank"** the next youngest of nine children, was
born in Arnprior, Ontario Canada on July 27, 1894 to Frank and Lavenia
Hill Raby. He registered for the draft in WWI in Canada, but in July 1914,
at the age of 19 he entered the US at Sault Ste Marie, Michigan. He
became a naturalized citizen in 1921, when he was living in Seattle,
Washington and working as a "clerk and oil operator".

About that time Frank came to Alaska and spent one summer at least
digging clams at a commercial clamming operation at Tuxedni Bay in Cook
Inlet. Seldovia resident John Gruber tells the story related by his
grandfather, Jack English who also hired on at Tuxedni Bay that year:
"My grandfather said,"I was watching this fella go out at low tide --
And they had wooden boxes, I think, that they towed. And they might have
had skegs on ‘em or something. And they would tow these wooden boxes
down, fill ’em with clams, and then other people would tow the wooden
boxes back up the beach, and then they would process ’em. But the fella
that dug the clams, that’s all he dug -- did, was dig the clam." My
grandfather said Frank would bend over and start diggin’, and he
wouldn’t straighten back up until the tide came back in. In other
words, he was a pretty good clam digger."

That winter when the cannery closed, Frank moved into Seldovia. It
didn’t take long before he was trying his hand at every money-making
operation going on in the area. In 1925 ten companies were listed in the
Pacific Fisherman’s Yearbook as packing herring in Seldovia, including
Frank Raby, with 27 barrels. Susan Springer in her book [_Seldovia, Alaska_](../_resources/books.md#seldovia-alaska-by-susan-springer)
suggests that Frank Raby was probably the first person in
Seldovia to attempt the raising of mink, which he did from 1923-1926. He
was also included in the long list of Kachemak Bay fox farmers. In the
1930 US Census, Frank was listed as a Seldovian salmon fisherman.

At some point Frank began to work as a clerk in the local grocery store
*Seldovia Cash Store*, owned by Charlie Sharp. It was next door to H.S.
Young Mercantile, operated by H. S. and Willie Young. The Youngs had
come to Alaska in 1916 and he was also from Canada. They had operated
similar mercantiles in Kenai, eventually ending up in Seldovia. H.S. was
older than Winnie, and eventually took ill and died in February 1945.
Exactly a year later, on February 23, 1946, Frank and Winnie O’Brien
Young were married in Seldovia. His occupation as listed on the marriage
application was "storekeeper". He opened a doorway between the two
stores and

Susan Springer also recounts another story told by former Seldovian Jim
Busey. Apparently Father Sarikovicoff, a Russian priest "helped to
support his large family by bootlegging. He was also in heavy debt to
Frank Raby, who was having trouble collecting payment. One day, Frank
spied the IRS boat steaming into Seldovia Bay. He ran and told the
Father, and together they moved the still into a back room at Frank’s
store. That’s where it stayed, the debt considered settled. Frank later
moved this still, or one similar, to his property at Raby’s Spit on the
west side of Seldovia Bay" (p182)

In 1948 Frank Raby sued Polar Bar owner Joe Hill to recover possession
of a town lot where the bar stood. It was described as Lot 3, Block One
of Frank Raby Subdivision of Section Lots 2, 3, and 8 of Section 32,
Township 8 South, Range 14, West of the Seward Meridian, within the
incorporated Town of Seldovia, Alaska, and being part of the Fulmore
Homestead, to which patent was issued November 21, 1930. Frank Raby
acquired this property in 1945. The evidence showed that beginning with
one Max Peyser who is said to have been on the land in question prior to
1924 and through 1941 when the testimony shows Mrs. John J. Roe died,
each person who lived on the land attempted to transfer his rights
thereto by bill of sale. Each bill of sale described personal property
only and each purported to transfer personal property only and none of
them described land so that it could be determined precisely what land
was attempted to be transferred. The evidence also shows that Roe's
predecessors did not transfer the land to their successors by deed, but
that each of them gave bills of sale to the buildings thereon. John Roe
gave Joe Hill a bill of sale in 1945 but that was determined not to be a
transfer of the deed, and Frank Raby prevailed.

In 1955 Frank Raby was registered as the owner of the Seldovia Mining
Company at Red Mountain, chromium prospecting. The company had a crew of
2 people.

Frank Raby died January 1984 in Seldovia and there is a memorial for him in Plot #95 in the Seldovia City Cemetery that he helped create by donating
the land to the City of Seldovia in 1934.
