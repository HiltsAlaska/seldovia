**RICHARD WILLIAM MILLER**, who always went by the name of "Dick", was
born in San Francisco California on May 2, 1908 to William Otis Miller
and Alma Amelia Hextrum Miller. He was the youngest of three brothers
and they were raised in Marin north of San Francisco.

Seldovia resident Mike Miller relates that when his dad was about 18
years old he made an agreement with his father. His father had some
property in La Honda, California and Dick promised that he would build
him a house if his father would send him to flying school. So Dick built
a house of redwood logs that is still standing and then he went to
flying school in Santa Maria, California.

About that time [**Grace Gleason**](./Miller_Avery_Grace_Gleason.md) was arriving in California. She had been
born on December 18, 1907 in Box Elder, Utah and she was of Mormon
stock, although her family weren’t practicing Mormons. Her cousin had
come to California before her and had married Dick’s older brother, so
they invited Grace to stay with them. Grace worked as a long distance
telephone operator in San Rafael. She and Dick were married and lived in
the house he built in La Honda while he commuted to San Francisco for
work.

It was difficult to get any flying jobs during the Depression so Dick
and a friend went to work on the Oakland Bay Bridge,
and then the Golden Gate Bridge. He was on a barge under the Golden Gate
Bridge lifting some heavy steel that fell and crushed his toes.

So both he and Ed quit and moved on to Seattle and got on a boat called
*The Discovery*. It was a mail boat that used to run out of Seward and
up Cook Inlet. They arrived in Seward in 1937, and were still not able
to find any flying jobs. But they did eventually get a job in Candle, on
the north side of the Seward Peninsula. There was quite a bit of gold
mining there and they got a job putting in access roads into the mines.
They worked one summer there and returned to California where they both
had families. The next summer Dick returned to Alaska and was finally
able to get a job flying out of Anchorage. He brought the family to
Anchorage and was based out of there from 1937 until 1945.

During that time he also taught flying lessons and taught almost 2,000
people to fly, including famous Denali bush pilot Don Sheldon.

In 1945, the year that Seldovia was incorporated as a "Second Class
City", it also saw its first airplane service: Miller's Seldovia Air
Service - 6 passenger double wing Waco float plane, pilot was Dick
Miller. The plane was tethered to the Seldovia dock. Harry White, a
pilot living in Kenai asked Dick to fly his plane and base out of
Seldovia for the summer. The family moved to Seldovia and lived in the
old Beachcomber Hotel. Dick had the airplane on a running line right
down on the beach in front of the hotel. It was quite a busy operation
in those days because there were four salmon canneries and they were
always flying people in and out. There was no airfield in Seldovia but when Beluga Lake was created in Homer it became possible
for floatplane travel between Seldovia and Homer. In 1947, Dick and a
partner, Earl Herr, bought a plane from Arnold Air Service in Anchorage.
Later that year they sold it to Merrill Ward Henington. More than $4000
had been paid on the purchase price by Henington when, on January 30,
1948, the plane disappeared from its ramp on the shore of Seldovia
Harbor. Some time later a wing float, identified as from that type of
plane, was brought to Seldovia and it was reported that it had washed
ashore about 10 miles from Seldovia.

Dick flew Harry White’s plane for two seasons and then bought his own
plane – a Stinson, a big radial engine on floats. During his second
season with that plane he was hauling gasoline in 5 gallon Blazo boxes
up to Jakolof Bay. He landed and taxied up to the beach, and jumped out
to get someone to help him unload the gas. He was away from the plane
when it suddenly exploded and burned up immediately. After that Dick
flew for several years but never owned another plane. One of the planes
he flew was a Seabee Republic, an amphibious aircraft. Then Dick and
Carl Nordenson, who was a commercial fisherman and owned the Linwood Bar
at the time, bought a three-seater Tri-Pacer. Dick flew that plane back
and forth to Homer for $8 each way. Then Alaska Airlines came in and
dropped the price to $6 and that was the end of Dick’s flying. Flying
was really important to him, but by then he had come to love Seldovia
and just didn’t want to pack up and leave. Dick flew out of Seldovia
between 1945 and 1950.

Next Dick became a loft foreman for Al Villa at the Alaska Shellfish
Company. That fall he became Chief of Police for the City of Seldovia.
It wasn’t a great paying job for a family man so he supplemented by
being the winter watchman at Alaska Year Round Canneries (AYR). There
was a house on the premises where the family could live and eat food
left over in the commissary.

Grace worked in Tyndle Lipke’s dress shop and in Frank Raby’s store for
a number of years.

In 1956, Dick died of cancer and the family moved back to Mill Valley,
California. Grace returned to Alaska one summer with both children and
they all went to Kodiak and fished with Fleming Giles. She stayed in California until she died in 1979.
