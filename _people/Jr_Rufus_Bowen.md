# Rufus Bowen, Jr.

## October 22, 1879, Alaska – September 1953, Alaska

**Rufus Bowen** was born in Kodiak October 22, 1879 and came to Seldovia
after the Novarupta eruption in 1912. He built a cabin where the
Harbor’s Edge is located and grazed horses in a pasture located where
the current SVT building stands. Later he lived in a cabin on the edge
of the Russian Orthodox Church Cemetery.

March 1919 - ARRIVAL OF PILGRIM MARKS FIRST MOVEMENT IN ANCHORAGE HARBOR
THIS YEAR. With the arrival here at 12.40 o'clock p. m., March 9 from
Seldovia of the gasoline power boat Pilgrim, the first movement of craft
in Anchorage harbor was recorded for the 1919 season. The movement this
year was almost a month earlier than in 1918 when the sailing April 11
of the gasoline power boat Swan for Knik marked the first water
activity. The Pilgrim, with a cargo of six tons of fresh eggs, fresh
fruit and butter consigned to J. J. Chisholm and with four persons
aboard of her, left Seldovia the fore-noon of March 6. She encountered
no ice until after she had passed the forelands, which are about six
hours' run from Anchorage. After having passed the forelands, she
sighted ice near to her but it did not interfere with her navigation and
required no attention at all until she was off Fire Island. Then she had
to take into account the ebb and fIow of quite a field of slush ice, but
she lost no time on account of it. She landed here near the dock of the
Alaskan Engineering Commission and was unloaded with-out difficulty. The
Pilgrim on her voyage from Seldovia was in charge of Pilot Rufe Bowen.
Her owner, Captain William Nelson, was aboard of her. She is scheduled
to leave Anchorage on her return to Seldovia late this afternoon or
to-morrow.

POWER BOAT PILGRIM LEAVES ON HER RETURN VOYAGE TO SELDOVIA. With three
persons aboard, the power boat Pilgrim left Anchorage at 2 o'clock p. m.
March 12, for Seldovia. Those on her were Captain William Nelson, her
owner; Rufe Bowen, her pilot, and William Murray. The Pilgrim was the
first craft to put into Anchorage harbor this year, having arrived March
9 with six tons of fresh eggs, fresh fruit and butter from Seldovia.
