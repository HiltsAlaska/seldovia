**Geraldine VICKARYOUS Patrick, "Gerry"** was born November 13, 1933 in Minnesota.


Gerry came to Alaska in 1935, as a two year old, with her parents, Tony and Alys Vickaryous and older sister "Tiny" as a Mat-Su Colonist family. She spent her childhood and most of her adult years in the Wasilla area and in Seldovia. 

Gerry did many things in her life, including farming, ownership of multiple business, nursing assistant, and school bus driver. Most importantly she was Mom and "Gram" to her large family. She set an example of community involvement through her volunteer efforts wherever she lived. 

She will be missed by many, including her living children David (Judy) Patrick, Rip (Sandra) Patrick, Mike Patrick, Nugget (Barbara) Patrick, Peach Barrus, and Mary (Ben) Dennis. She will also be missed by her many grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and large extended family.
