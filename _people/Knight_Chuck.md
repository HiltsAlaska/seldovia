**Charles Edward Knight,"Chuck"** was born in Vallejo, California, on Nov. 19, 1932 to Horace Knight and Dorothy Van Val Kingburg, who raised him in various communities throughout California and Oregon. 

In August 1950, he married Beverly J. Moore of Grants Pass, Ore., with whom he had three daughters. 
Chuck spent his early years in the Los Angeles, Calif., area working for Arden Farms Dairy as a milkman and various other jobs.

In 1961 he moved his family from Santa Rosa, Calif., to Seldovia, Alaska, after purchasing H.S. Young Mercantile. After the 1964 Alaska earthquake, he was instrumental in the reconstruction effort for the City of Seldovia and he built Bayview Mercantile. 

During his time in Seldovia he served as a city council member, mayor, Kenai Borough Assembly Representative, and member and president of the Chamber of Commerce. 
After selling his store in Seldovia, he worked for 10 years as a teamster in the oil fields in Prudoe Bay, Alaska, during the oil pipeline years. After retiring in 1983 he drove a cab in Anchorage on and off until moving to Pahrump. 

Chuck met Laurie Worden in Anchorage on April Fools Day in 1979. They were in Alaska until March 1992, when they moved to Pahrump. A few weeks later they filed an application to operate Pahrump Valley Taxi and in December 1992, they began the service. It was the first and only cab business in the valley. The couple married in December 1993. 

In 1999 they added Classy Lady Limo, the only limousine service in Nye County, to their growing business. They were the sole owners for 11-1/2 years until 2003, when they sold the business due to Chuck's failing health. 

Chuck loved roses, other flowers and nature. His family described him as "one-of-a-kind, always had a super great smile, a kindness that was unmatched and a love for life and people." 
He lived a very full life and once stated, "I didn't miss much in life, I did pretty much a little of everything." He will be missed and remembered by all those who knew and loved him. 
His wife Laurie Knight of Pahrump; brother Ron (Mary) Knight of Grants Pass, Ore.; two half-sisters Carol and Jeannie of California; daughters Chris Woodward of Grants Pass, Cathy (John) Seville of Burlington, Wash., and Cindy (Tim) Callahan of Mt. Vernon, Wash.; three grandchildren, Melissa (Giuseppe) of San Diego, Calif., MaiLani Kaililauu and James Woodford of Grants Pass; great grandson Cameron; and many aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and stepchildren survive him.
