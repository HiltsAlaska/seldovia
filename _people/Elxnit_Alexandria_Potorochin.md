**Alexandria Potorochin  Elxnit** is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in plot 228.  The cause of death is unknown.

City records Mrs. Elxnit with an illegible notation that looks like Horc Vesam's mother. 1980 information records her as Shura Elxnit. Darlene Crawford says Shura was Nick Elxnit's mother.
