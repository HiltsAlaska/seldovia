# MOONIN FAMILY

The **Moonin** name originates with the 1880s missionary
**John Moonin**. In the 1830s John Moonin (Munin) was born
in San Francisco. He was of Russian, American Indian, and Spanish
ancestry. During the 1850s, Moonin and his first wife moved to Kodiak
Island. After she died, he married Helen Medvidnikoff whose father was
Russian and mother was Aleut. Moonin and his new wife volunteered to do
missionary work in Seldovia during the 1860s. He was a lay reader and
paid by the Russian government to conduct the activities of the church,
including services and baptisms. Having lived in Seldovia only a short
time, Moonin and his wife moved to Nanwalek where they settled. One son
of John and Helen Moonin was Nicholas, born in 1874, who became an
Orthodox priest and the patriarch of Nanwalek until his death in 1972.
