# Unknowns

Section 3, \#146: Interred August 1938

The body of an unidentified white man was found on the beach at
Niggerhead Point near Seldovia. He hands were missing and most of the
head. The back part of the skull appeared to be fractured. R. Wm. Kirby
of Seldovia expressed the opinion that the body had been in the water
apparently three and one half months. The doctor also estimated the
man’s age was about 35 years. He was a small man with very small feet,
well-dressed in a blue serge suit and shirt. A pair of lenseless glasses
were found on the body, also a fountain pen and a box of snuff. There
were no identification marks whatever upon the body. The body did not
appear to be that of a fisherman, but a man that had followed some other
occupation. The coroner’s jury brought in a verdict of death from
unknown causes. Source: *Fairbanks* *News Miner, September 13, 1938*
