**JOHN PHILLIP ENGLISH, "Jack"** was born in Strathroy, Canada in 1905 and came to
Seldovia in 1923 to work for Snug Harbor Packing Company. When it closed
down for the winter, he decided he didn’t want to be a winter watchman
at Tuxedni Bay as he had the previous winter, so he ended up staying in
Seldovia during the winter of ’23, ’24. He met [**Susan Bloch**](./English_Susan_Bloch.md) and they were
married in December of 1925.

From Larry Reynolds: "Anyway, some fun stories about Jack. Cheryl went over to visit him one
rainy, stormy night. We’d been working in the clinic but the power went
off, so we decided, "Oh well, that’s the end of that."

And so she went over to the newsstand, which is next to the post office.
That empty room usually now that used to be the newsstand and -- and
Susan and Jack ran that.

Anyway, they were sitting around in the dark, talking and Jack says to
Cheryl, "Well, let’s have some fun with this power outage." So -- so he
calls up, and I don’t know who he called but he called somebody.

And said, "Yeah, it was Gladys. She was on a snow machine and she ran
over the power cord going up to the TV tower." He hangs up the phone. He
says, "Let’s give it five."

In other words, how long is it going to take for the story to get back
to him in a different form. And it did, too. Five minutes later somebody
called and told us it was -- it was Helen and -- And, anyway, funny
story.
