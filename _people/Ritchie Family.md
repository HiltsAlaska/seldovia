# RITCHIE FAMILY

# Ulysses Grant Ritchie

## October 1868, Pa -- May 1953, Seldovia, Alaska

# George Ritchie

## 1905, Seldovia, Alaska - December 1952, Seldovia, Alaska

**Ulysses Grant "U.S." Ritchie** is first listed in Alaska
in 1910 census records where he is living on Yukon Island, with his wife
**Annie** and sons, **George**, Sam, and Jim. Annie was
born in Alaska. In 1920, only son George is listed with them.

In 1921 U.S. had applied for a post as US Postmaster in Seldovia, but
failed to qualify. George married **Mary Simeneoff** in 1923 and U.S.
married **Mary Toco** in 1925. In 1930 U.S. is listed in Seldovia as a
widower living with son George, also a widower; he is a carpenter and
George is a fisherman. In 1940 both U.S. and George are living together
in Seldovia, and both are listed as widowers but I haven't found a
record of a marriage for George.

Near where the theater used to be, George built a two story house with
lots of shingles and a round tower, where he could sun bathe on it. The
next year the BIA school was built right across the street and he didn't
get to do much sun bathing (From Fred Elvsaas interview)
