# CRAWFORD FAMILY

**Reynard Leroy Crawford** was born in Washington in 1915. He came to
Anchorage in 1919 with his parents on the S.S. Northwestern, which
anchored in the Inlet near Anchorage. Because there were no docking
facilities, the passengers were ferried to shore aboard smaller boats.
He grew up in Anchorage and attended local schools. Later he became a
fur trapper near McGrath. He married Hettie Hultberg Conrad and they had
three children. The family moved from McGrath to Anchorage, Fairbanks,
and eventually Seldovia in about 1948. Leroy worked on fishing tenders
boats and later had his own mechanical shop. He died in Seward in 1973
and is buried there near his parents.

# Henrietta "Hettie" HULTBERG Crawford

# 1908, Alaska -- June 16, 1981, Seldovia, Alaska

**Henrietta Maria "Hettie" HULTBERG Crawford** was one of
four children born to John Oliver Hultberg and Helen Alarpakorak in the
Bethel district of Alaska, about 1908. Her mother was the daughter of
Herman Bever and was born in Quinahok. Her father was a miner from
Illinois and he left Alaska and lived the rest of his life in
California. Helen later married Karl Konig and in 1920 Hettie and her
sister Freida were living with their stepfather and Helen's Konig
children in McGrath. Since Hettie and Freida are listed with the last
name Conrad, their mother may have been married to a Conrad before Carl
Konig. In McGrath Hettie met **Leroy Crawford** and they
married and had three children: John, Helen (Nagy) and Diane. The family
moved from McGrath to Anchorage, Fairbanks, and eventually Seldovia in
about 1948. Leroy worked on fishing tenders boats and later had his own
machine shop. He died in Seward in 1973. Hettie continued to live in
Seldovia until her death on June 16, 1981. She is buried in the Seldovia
City Cemetery, Plot \#531.
