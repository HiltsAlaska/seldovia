10/11/22 ~ 01/13/09 Tuggle passed away January 13, 2009 at Overlake Hospital in Bellevue, WA, from a massive stroke. His wife, Esther and daughter, Jan, were at his bedside throughout his stay of four days. A Veteran of POW of WWII serving in the 102nd Infantry Division, 1942 - 1945. In 1946 he and his brother Pierre, also a veteran of WWII, traveled to Alaska. Long time Alaska commercial fisherman, Tuggle made his home in Seldovia, Alaska for 63 years. After his retirement, he was an ardent fly fisherman, enjoying his favorite pastime with many friends and traveling to some of the best fishing waters in the world and of course, Alaska. All who knew Tuggle will not forget the twinkle in his eye as he told stories, his original quotes and his ever-present, mischievous smile. Always ready with a helping hand, he was the first on the scene to help a friend or neighbor. He enjoyed jewelry making, woodworking of many types, tying flies for his fly-fishing friends and trying new styles. All will dearly miss him, but he leaves many happy memories for us to keep in our hearts. Tuggle was preceded in death by his two brothers, Lester and Duane. He leaves his loving wife of 57 years, Esther; his daughter, Jan; grandchildren, Megan and John; great grandson, Kazen; brothers, Rodney and Pierre, their families and many nieces and nephews, all with fond memories of the many years we were blessed to have him. Respecting Tuggle's wishes, no funeral services will be held.
