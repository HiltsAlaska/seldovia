**Nell CARTER Scott** was the first woman to serve in the Alaska Territorial Legislature, serving a single term in the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives from 1937 to 1939.
Nell was born in Marengo, Michigan, to George and Maggie May CLEVELAND Carter on November 9, 1900. She attended public schools in Seattle, Washington, and moved to Anchorage, Alaska from Seattle with her husband Dick Scott in 1923. While in Anchorage, she worked as a legal secretary. They relocated to Seldovia, Alaska when Dick was appointed Deputy United States Marshal in 1934.

The 1936 election for the Territory of Alaska Legislature had two females; Scott on the Democratic ticket and Juanita Anderson on the Independent Party ticket, competing for one of 4 available seats in the 3rd District. Alaska in territorial days had only 4 legislative districts; the 3rd District covered an area roughly from the Copper River valley and Prince William Sound west to Bristol Bay and the Aleutian Islands. In this sprawling and (at the time) sparsely populated area, Scott campaigned by piloting her plane across her district and meeting people one on one. She won election and on January 11, 1937, Scott took a seat in the Territory of Alaska Legislature. Scott was the only representative from the 3rd District in this legislature not to hail from Anchorage. She served only one term, and then moved back to Washington State for personal reasons. 

Dick and Nell divorced, and Nell twice remarried (Pomeroy/Chadwick) and died on April 16, 2001 in Washington.
