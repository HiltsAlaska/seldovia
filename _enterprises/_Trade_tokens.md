**Trade Tokens in Seldovia**

A common practice for early remote merchants in remote areas of Alaska, including Seldovia, was the use of privately minted tokens which they used in place of coins which were hard to keep on hand. These old “coins” are collectors’ items today and may sell for hundreds of dollars each.

Trade tokens in Alaska actually go back to the 18th century fur trading era and then were repurposed in the late 19th century when the Alaska Gold Rush occurred.

**Fur-trading Era**
The earliest trade tokens in the North American fur trade were simple counters.  When a Native trapper delivered his furs the clerk responsible for grading and assigning the value of the furs gave the Indian counters representing the value of the furs.  The Indian then walked over to the trade room where he exchanged his counters for goods.  If any credit remained after his purchases the clerk collected any remaining counters and made an appropriate notation in his account book.  Most of these early tokens were simple, plain disks of copper, brass or even wood.  
Because the early tokens were unmarked and easily counterfeited, and also because improvements in Native transportation resulted in Native trappers expanding their range of operations, a method was needed which would allow the trapper to receive credit from posts other than the one where he originally handed over his furs.  The solution was to offer trade-tokens as an alternative to currency.  

**Gold Rush Era**
By the beginning of the 20th century, gold was discovered throughout Alaska. This resulted in an influx of gold miners into Alaska. At first, gold dust was primarily used as the medium of exchange since U.S. coins and currency was scarce in Alaska. 

Abuses of how gold dust was handled resulted in the use of trade tokens in Alaska. These tokens were used like coins or currency with the local store or merchant in that local community. The beauty of using these tokens was that they stayed in that community and could continue to be used as a medium of exchange. It also provided for a degree of economic stability for that region. 

Trade tokens continued to be used right up into the 1950s and could be found everywhere in use in Alaska. Their use died away as more and more U.S. coinage and  currency began to circulate in Alaska, and after Statehood, tokens became more commemorative than trade items..
