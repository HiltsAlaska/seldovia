# **Linwood Bar and Grill**

The Linwood Bar and Grill was started by Carl Lindstedt and Grace Lloyd Nordensen.
The name “Linwood” is a combination of “Lin” for Carl Lindstedt and “Wood” from   his sister-in-law Laura’s married name, Laura Wood.  
People remember that there was a big room in the back that they had a theater in. They had movies and then there was a restaurant in the front called The Coffee Cup.  It was just a little hole in the wall greasy spoon type, although you could get any kind of a meal.

The Linwood has had many owners and several locations but through the years the name has stayed the same.
At one point it was owned by Shorty Bailey. When he died his wife wasn’t interested in running a bar so John and Alta Colberg leased and then bought it. The Colbergs  operated the Linwood for more than 20 years. John worked evenings and Alta worked mornings.
