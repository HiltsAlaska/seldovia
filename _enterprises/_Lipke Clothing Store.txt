# **Lipke's Clothing Store**


Alice Lipke, who came to Seldovia before 1930 with her husband, [**Adam Lipke**](../_people/Lipke_Adam_W.md), noticed that there weren't many articles of women's clothing for sale in Seldovia.  She purchased a stock of coats, shoes, dresses and children's clothing and then acquired a storefront on the boardwalk next to her husband's wirelss station and opened Lipke's Clothing Store. 

After her divorce and her husband's remarriage, his second wife Tyndle operated the store.
