# **Polar Bar**

The Polar Bar located on the east side of Main Street and south side of Bay Street, was owned first by [**John Roe**](../_people/Roe_John.md).  He began renting the business to Joe Hill in 1941. In January 1945 he sold the business, and then the land to Joe Hill. 

John J. Roe, one of defendant's witnesses, testifies that he has lived in Seldovia since 1924 and that one Max Peyser then occupied the land in question and that prior to his occupancy, one Reynard occupied it. He identifies a bill of sale, dated January 6, 1925, from Max Peyser to Mrs. John Roe, his wife, covering a one-story frame building, 25' x 16', with addition in rear known as the Peyser Building, situated between the Anderson Mercantile Company's store and the store of M.E. Shortley, on the "beach line," and testifies that this instrument gave his wife the title which he (not his wife) on January 30, 1945 transferred by his bill of sale to the defendant.
