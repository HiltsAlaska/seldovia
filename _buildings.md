Prior to  the 2008 sewar and water project the only Seldovia properties listed in the Alaska Heritage Resource Survey or AHRS - the sate-wide inventory of archaeological and historic architecture properties maintained by the Alaska Office of History and Archaeology, were the town of Seldovia itself (SEL-084) and the Russian Orthodox Church (SEL-023.  Susan Springer, in her book "Seldovia, Alaska - An Historical Portrait of Life in Herring Bay" created a list of old buildings in Seldovia, along with short descriptions of their history. To provide additional context for the archaeological monitoring effort an assist in tracking Seldovia's historic buildings, AHRS numbers were obtained for those buildings as well as two others.  The inventory is not necessarily complete, and there are likely other old buildings in Seldovia that deserve to be added.
